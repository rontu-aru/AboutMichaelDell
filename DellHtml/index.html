      <p> Michael Saul Dell has been, and is, one of the front runners in the
        evolution and over all development of the computer science field.
        However, he didn’t start out as a brilliant entrepreneur or business
        executive. He got his start in business by selling computer disk drives
        out of his college dorm room. After his small, almost miniscule business
        gained momentum, he moved out of the dorms and filled an apartment with
        a whole host of computer parts and building new computers to sell. But
        building and selling computers is not the only contribution that Dell
        provided, rather, Dell Inc. fundamentally pioneered Internet commerce.
        Which, essentially entails, “the use of the Internet for all phases of
        creating and completing business transactions.” </p>
